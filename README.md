Light at night
To comfort cold
tightens on the face
Who is there in the dark of night.

Burn hot like a heart
Look forward to the bonfire light
Maybe someone will come out of the darkness closer to the light.

Light up, shine and never let it stop to burn it down to warm your hands up and keep your eyes open as the only hope
Although your own
Ignited lights at night.
